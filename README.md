# 项目介绍
# Introduction
这个项目是大三的时候做高级软件实作的作品，我和舍友一起模仿taptap网站的界面做了一个应用展示的网站，这也是我第一次使用vue框架来做前端界面。
由于当时不熟悉用git来管理项目，所以导致前端工作的分工上有差异，我的部分没有使用任何组件库，前端样式全部都说自己用css来写的。而另一个负责前端的同学则使用了Element UI组件库，因为他对前端工作的不熟悉，所以不太会编写前端样式。这样就导致了他负责的前端界面样式与我负责的前端界面样式不兼容，使得部分界面中的组件出现错位。
这个git项目的分支有个1.0版本的项目，这是我们提交上去的最终作品。由于当时我们都是技术新手，项目中的很多地方都设计得不够完美，并且技术方面只使用了vue框架中的一小部分。因此，我打算在闲暇时间重写一下整个前端界面，并且完善当时项目中由于赶工期而没有实现的功能。当时的后端开发是我的另一个舍友做的，他使用的是springboot+springMVC+mybatis，使用redis作为数据缓存，docker来作为容器。尽管我略懂一些使用springboot来开发CRUD的东西，但是这次我打算使用node.js来作为项目的后端，以检验我学习node.js的成果。

This project was a work of advanced software implementation in my junior year. My roommates and I made a website for application display by imitating Taptap website. This was the first time that I used Vue.js framework and other knowledge of web front-end to make front-end interface.
Because I was not familiar with git to manage the project at that time, there was a difference in the division of front-end work. I did not use any componenet library for my part, and all the front-end styles were written by CSS. Another front-end roommates used the Element-UI componenet library, because he was not familiar with front-end work, so he was not good at designing front-end styles. As a result, the front-end interface style he was responsible for was incompatible with that I was responsible for, and some components in the interface wre misaligned. 
This branch of the git project had a version 1.0 project, and this is the final work we submitted. Since we were all new to technology at the time, many parts of the project were not perfectly designed and only a fraction of the technical aspects of the vue framework were used. Therefore, I decided to redesign the entire front-end interface in my spare time and improve the features that were not implemented in the project due to deadlines. Since the roomate who developed the back end no longer want to maintain and improve the back end of the project, I decided to implement the back end again by myself. He uses Springboot+SpringMVC+Mybatis, using Redis as data cache and Docker as container. Although I know a little bit about using Springboot for CRUD development, this time i am going to use Node.js as the back end of my project to test the results of my node.js learning.
